Ans:3.
a event happens when you click something,this is called target, then the even moves upward starting any event listner on the parent element its called bubbling

Ans:4.
we add an event listener to the parent container. and when an event occurs on a child it bubbles up, them we check which child triggered the event

its useful because it works even for the elements added after the page loads, and we need fewer events

Ans:5.
->preventDefault() prevents default action of an element from happening

->stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling in the dom
